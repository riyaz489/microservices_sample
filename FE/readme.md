crate react app: 
npx create-react-app react-crud --template typescript

npm start

first package is for js and second is for ts, so for all packages we need to do this way:
for specific path we need to call different component, for that we are uing below package:
npm i react-router-dom  @types/react-router-dom

npm i sass @types/sass

-d flag in `npm install is to install dev dependencies, those dependencies then will not go to prod env
